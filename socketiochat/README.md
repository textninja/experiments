# Socket.io demo

This is a rough draft attempt at using socket.io to create a chat app. It's got all the features: a frontend, a backend, a way to read messages, a way to write messages...

## Buyer beware

This is a throwaway practice implementation which does not include a data persistence layer, tests, or any sane options for scaling. It is also a rat's nest of spaghetti code, with bugs lurking in the dank crevices of slipshod architecture and stylistic faux pas. Don't come here expecting a beauteous or even complete implementation. In fact, you probably shouldn't use this at all. Aesthetically, it looks like someone ran `ls` on a git objects directory, and its ugliness is more than skin deep.

Posted as a point of reference only, to hopefully improve upon with more robust abstractions.
